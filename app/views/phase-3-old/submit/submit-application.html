        <li>to the best of my knowledge, the information provided is complete and accurate, demonstrating that the relevant criteria have been met</li>
        <li>to the best of my knowledge, any applicable supporting documents have been included, and no information submitted is false or misleading</li>
        <li>I have explored alternative options and confirm that, to the best of my knowledge, the selected project represents the most suitable and effective approach to meet the intended objectives and I would be able to provide evidence of this if requested by the DfE</li>
        <li>due regard has been given to duties under the Public Sector Equality Duty</li>
        <li>the project will comply with all relevant statutory obligations, including public procurement regulations and guidance</li>
        <li>the governing body, relevant freehold landowner, and, where applicable, the religious authority support the proposal</li>
        <li>the delivery of this project will not hinder my estates' capacity to fulfil other statutory duties, including but not limited to <a href="">Breakfast Clubs (opens in a new tab)</a></li>
        <li>there has been due consideration of the local market in collaboration with relevant Local Authorities, with the project enhancing the overall local offer without negatively impacting provision in close proximity including that delivered by external providers</li>
        <li>funding will be used solely for the eligible costs of the specified works, and any underspend will be returned to the DfE</li>
        <li>grant funding will only be used for eligible costs incurred after the grant is awarded (retrospective claims will not be accepted)</li>
        <li>any additional funding sources required to complete this proposal have been agreed and secured by the LA or school or relevant parties</li>
        <li>any conflicts of interest (for example, relationships with technical advisors or contractors) have been declared and appropriate action taken</li>
        <li>no prior DfE funding has been received that would result in double funding (for example, if funding was received through the 2023 to 24 Childcare Expansion Capital Grant, this project must deliver additional places)</li>
        <li>if the funded activities are not completed by 1 September 2027, the DfE reserves the right to recover the grant (this is referred to as clawback)</li>
        <li>the department will not be liable for additional costs above the grant awarded and you will provide regular updates to DfE as required</li>
        <li>if the use of AI tools has been used to support the generation of the application (such as in building responses to assessment questions) they have been checked and verified for accuracy</li>
        <li>should this project be successful, the procurement of this contract will be in accordance with the Local Authority's Standing Orders and the lowest tender that meets your requirements should be accepted, unless clear evidence and rationale supports otherwise and unless prior agreement is given by DfE</li>
