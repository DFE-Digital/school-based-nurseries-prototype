  <p class="govuk-body">Tell us your new nursery capacity for each age group. Your total must be greater than the current capacity for 2025 to 2026 as detailed earlier in your application. If you are staggering the opening of your nursery, please specify the maximum capacity it is expected to reach once fully operational.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">This should reflect the maximum number of children you will have at any given time in the nursery space, not necessarily the total capacity of the space, for example if your staff structure doesn't allow. Do not double count places used in both morning and afternoon sessions. Only include the highest number of children expected to be present at once.</p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Please note your project must deliver a minimum of 5 additional childcare places. In exceptional circumstances, we may consider projects that deliver fewer than 5 additional places For example, if this utilises existing staffing structures more efficiently or the places are serving a small rural community. Such cases will be subject to a thorough due diligence process, during which we may seek clarification from applicants to inform our decision.</p>
